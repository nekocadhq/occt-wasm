/**
 * Regression test for chained fillet/chamfer.
 *
 * `BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet::Shape()` and `MakeChamfer::Shape()` return a
 * `TopoDS_Compound` even when the input was a single solid and the result is
 * a single solid. The facade stored that compound as-is, so the *next*
 * fillet/chamfer — which downcasts its input with `TopoDS::Solid(...)` —
 * failed with `Standard_TypeMismatch`, surfacing as a WASM trap
 * (`fillet: TopoDS::Solid`). Every fillet was therefore a one-shot: chaining
 * two of them, the ordinary way to break a sharp edge and then soften the
 * result, could not work at all.
 *
 * OCP's direct pybind11 binding has no facade in between, so the same OCCT
 * call chains there; the divergence was ours, not OCCT's.
 *
 * The facade now unwraps a compound holding exactly one solid before storing
 * it. A compound holding several solids is left alone, so nothing that
 * legitimately produces multiple solids is flattened.
 *
 * Note that this is about the *result* type. Passing a compound *in* — a
 * boolean result, say — is still rejected by the `TopoDS::Solid` downcast,
 * which is what the error-decoding tests in new-features.test.ts rely on.
